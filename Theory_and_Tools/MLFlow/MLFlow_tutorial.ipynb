    "MLFlow - is an open source platform for managing ML workflows. MLFlow has 4 main components:\n",
    "- Tracking component - allows to record ML training sessions (runs) and run queries using Python and REST APIs.\n",
    "- The model component - provides a standard unit for packaging and reusing machine learning models.\n",
    "- The model registry component - lets you centrally manage models and their lifecycle.\n",
    "- The project component - packages code used in Data Science projects, ensuring it can easily be reused and experiments can be reproduced"

    "- A Run - is a collection of parameters, metrics, labels and artifacts related to the training process of a ML model.\n",
    "- An Experiment - is the basic unit of MLFlow organization. All MLflow runs belong to an experiment. For each experiment, you can analyze and compare the results of different runs, and easily retrieve metadata artifacts for analysis using downstream tools. Experiments are maintained on an MLFlow tracking server hosted onn Azure Databricks."
